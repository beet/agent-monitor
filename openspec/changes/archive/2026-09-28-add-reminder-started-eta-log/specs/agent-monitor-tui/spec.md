## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Logs tab shows an aggregated, paginated activity list
The Logs tab SHALL display the activity log entries received from the daemon, aggregated across all projects, as a paginated list ordered by recency (most recent first) by default. Each entry SHALL show at least its project, event category, status, and event time, with event time as the last (rightmost) column, consistent with the Agents tab's UPDATED column. Each entry's status SHALL use the same emoji marker and color styling as that status uses in the Agents tab, so status is visually distinguishable the same way it already is there. A test-run entry whose status is "passed" or "failed", an agent entry whose status is "done", or a reminder entry whose status is "finished" or "stopped", SHALL additionally show the elapsed duration of that run/task/reminder, computed from the most recent preceding "started" entry of the same category logged for the same project - for a reminder entry, additionally matched to the "started" entry recording the same reminder name, since a project can have more than one reminder interleaved in the log and an agent/test-run has no equivalent identity to disambiguate by. A reminder entry whose status is "started" SHALL additionally show its recorded ETA (the reminder's local-time due time, `HH:MM`, as recorded on that entry - see the activity-log capability), rather than the elapsed duration shown for other completed entries, since a just-started reminder has no elapsed run to show. Whenever the list holds more entries than fit on a single page, the Logs tab SHALL display a Ratatui vertical `Scrollbar` widget along its right edge, positioned so the scrollbar's thumb reaches the very bottom of its track when the list's last page is being shown (and the very top when its first page is being shown), and its heading SHALL append a pagination keyboard-shortcut hint alongside its existing sort and filter hints; neither the scrollbar nor the pagination hint SHALL be shown when every (filtered) entry already fits on a single page.

#### Scenario: Logs tab lists recent activity across projects
- **WHEN** the user switches to the Logs tab
- **THEN** the TUI displays activity log entries from every project, most recent first, split into pages

#### Scenario: A new entry arrives while viewing the Logs tab
- **WHEN** the daemon pushes a new activity log entry while the Logs tab is active
- **THEN** the TUI incorporates it into the list without requiring the user to restart or reconnect

#### Scenario: Log entry statuses are visually distinguishable
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders an entry's status
- **THEN** that status is prefixed with the same emoji marker and styled with the same color it would use in the Agents tab

#### Scenario: A completed test run shows its duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "passed" or "failed" test-run entry that has a preceding "test-run"/"started" entry logged for the same project
- **THEN** the row includes the elapsed duration between that "started" entry and this one

#### Scenario: A completed agent task shows its duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "done" agent entry that has a preceding "agent"/"started" entry logged for the same project
- **THEN** the row includes the elapsed duration between that "started" entry and this one

#### Scenario: A started test run with no completion shows no duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "started" test-run entry
- **THEN** the row shows no duration for it, since the run has not yet completed in the log

#### Scenario: The Logs tab's timestamp column is the last column
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders its header and rows
- **THEN** the event-time column appears after the project, category, and status columns, rather than before them

#### Scenario: A scrollbar appears once entries overflow a page
- **WHEN** the Logs tab's (filtered) entries hold more rows than fit on a single page
- **THEN** the TUI renders a vertical scrollbar along the pane's right edge, reflecting the current page's position within the full list

#### Scenario: No scrollbar when everything fits on one page
- **WHEN** the Logs tab's (filtered) entries all fit within a single page
- **THEN** no scrollbar is rendered

#### Scenario: The heading gains a pagination hint once entries overflow a page
- **WHEN** the Logs tab's (filtered) entries hold more rows than fit on a single page
- **THEN** its heading shows a hint for the pagination keys alongside its existing sort and filter hints

#### Scenario: No pagination hint when everything fits on one page
- **WHEN** the Logs tab's (filtered) entries all fit within a single page
- **THEN** its heading shows no pagination hint, only the sort and filter hints

#### Scenario: The scrollbar thumb reaches the bottom of the track on the last page
- **WHEN** the Logs tab's (filtered) entries hold more rows than fit on a single page, and the list is scrolled to its last page
- **THEN** the scrollbar's thumb is positioned flush against the bottom of its track, not stopping short of it

#### Scenario: A finished reminder shows its elapsed duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "finished" reminder entry that has a preceding "started" entry logged for the same project and the same reminder name
- **THEN** the row includes the elapsed duration between that "started" entry and this one

#### Scenario: A stopped reminder shows its elapsed duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "stopped" reminder entry that has a preceding "started" entry logged for the same project and the same reminder name
- **THEN** the row includes the elapsed duration between that "started" entry and this one

#### Scenario: A started reminder with no completion shows no duration
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "started" reminder entry
- **THEN** the row shows no duration for it, since it has not yet stopped or finished in the log

#### Scenario: A started reminder shows its ETA
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "started" reminder entry
- **THEN** the row includes that entry's recorded ETA (`HH:MM`, local time) alongside its name

#### Scenario: Interleaved reminders in the same project do not cross-match durations
- **WHEN** the Logs tab renders a "finished" or "stopped" reminder entry, and a different reminder in the same project also has "started"/"finished"/"stopped" entries interleaved with it in the log
- **THEN** the displayed duration is computed only from that reminder's own preceding "started" entry (matched by reminder name), not another reminder's
