## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Agent registry
The daemon SHALL maintain a registry of known agents keyed by session identifier, recording working directory, host context (nvim, standalone terminal, or desktop app), process id, current status, and last-updated timestamp. The registry SHALL reject a "needs input" event for a session whose current status is already "done", since a finished session cannot legitimately need input again until a new "running" event is reported for it. The registry SHALL hold at most one entry per pid: when an event's session id is new but its pid matches an existing entry under a different session id, the registry SHALL remove that existing entry before registering the new one, since the same pid starting a new session id (for example, via `/clear`) means the old session is gone, not merely quiet.

#### Scenario: First event for a session registers a new agent
- **WHEN** the daemon receives an event for a session id it has not seen before, and its pid does not match any existing entry
- **THEN** it creates a new registry entry with the reported working directory, host context, pid, and status

#### Scenario: Subsequent event updates the existing agent
- **WHEN** the daemon receives an event for a session id already in the registry
- **THEN** it updates that entry's status and last-updated timestamp instead of creating a duplicate

#### Scenario: A late needs-input event cannot override a completed session
- **WHEN** the daemon receives a "needs input" event for a session whose current status is already "done"
- **THEN** the daemon leaves that agent's status as "done" and does not apply the "needs input" event

#### Scenario: A new running event still clears a completed session's status
- **WHEN** the daemon receives a "running" event for a session whose current status is "done"
- **THEN** it updates that entry's status to "running" as normal

#### Scenario: A new session id for an already-tracked pid replaces the old entry
- **WHEN** the daemon receives an event for a session id it has not seen before, and its pid matches an existing entry registered under a different session id
- **THEN** the daemon removes the existing entry for that pid and registers the new session id as the sole entry for that pid, instead of the two entries coexisting
